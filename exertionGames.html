                <h3>New concept exertion gaming</h3>
                <p>Many music videos have choreographies. These are most of the time easy to dance, mainly giving the artist an easy task while singing. The outcome of this is that many youngsters try to obtain these choreographies, wishfully that they can dance along while listening to the specific song. Just to name a few examples: New Boyz - "You're a A Jerk"; Beyonce - "Single Ladies; and Rej3ctz ft Chris Brown - "Catdaddy". Not only is this done in the Western culture, but also the Eastern culture, such as South-Korea. Many exchange students are from South-Korea, and are taking classes at the THUAS. Dancing along with each other creates movement and most of the time laughing, resulting in bonding and relaxation. Aiming at a quicker way to create a connection among the students, which is important especially for the foreign students, because it will make it easier for them to feel secure, as well as calm and loosened up. Also, it gives an insight of what popular is in foreign countries/different cultures, hoping to connect one another. It'll be an extension of the game "Dance Along", though the aim is at songs that are popular in the Western and Eastern cultures and the actual choreographies of the music videos together. </p>

                <p>Laughter Tree is a game based on a laugh therapy activity. ‘Self-expression through bodily play for children in hospital’ is a research project that investigates the interrelationship between Bodily Self-expression and Body image and how this interrelation can be used through digital play to improve children’ self-esteem, children’s emotional expression, bodily expression and body image perception in sick children. The project will create an opportunity for children to express themselves, become co-designers and have fun. It will be conducted in the Day Care Medical Unit at The Royal Children’s Hospital (Melbourne, Australia).
                The research aims to increase the knowledge and use of arts in health environments. The contribution of this project to the existing knowledge relies on the capacity of the interrelation between bodily self-expression and body image to be used in play and digital games as an expressive tool. In doing so the research focuses not only on the potential of the expressive use of a created artefact but also on the creative process itself while giving an opportunity to kids to express themselves and be creative.
                The key research question is: How understanding the interrelation between bodily self-expression and body image can facilitate play for sick children and their families in hospital environments?

				<p>Musical Embrace is a digital research game that demonstrates how to use social awkwardness as a successful play element. In Musical Embrace two players are invited to control a pillow, which hangs from the ceiling, with their torsos in order to cooperatively navigate a virtual world filled with sound sources. By exploring uncomfortable interactions such as social awkwardness, we are illustrating the potential benefits of social awkwardness and bodily interactions; along with enriching our understanding of what computer games can and should be in the future.

                Musical Embrace by Amy Huggard, Anushka ‘Chet’ De Mel and Jayden Garner with support from Chad Toprak, Alan Chatham and Florian ‘Floyd’ Mueller.</p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>At first glance at the topic I was quite unsure. I'm not a gamer at all, most of the time I find gaming a waste of time to be exact. Though, after a few examples I felt like it made much more sense, in a way that it could actually work effectively. It came to the point that exertion games is quite logical.<br/>The generation that we live in at the very moment is most of the time easily bored. If they can't find the dopamine that it creates, they'll just move along and find it somewhere else, especially since the competition in tech is becoming bigger. For me the future will expanse in the creativity. Minimalism, loneliness, and depression has been done - through social media - , and people are in for more brighter colours, relaxation, and alleviation. Adding to that, the days, at the moment, are looking less at what is not possible, though more at what could be super awesome, even when it sounds too abstract. Perhaps exertion games will become a norm, in a way that people will feel habituated to overcome obstacles than when they couldn't use games.<br/>The subject of this topic went way above my expections. Especially because there is a vast amount of finding ways to make regular activities entertaining. Not only for the young people, but also for the eldery.  </p>
